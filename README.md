# ICMP-Tunnel
This POC will involve a C&C server and an agent. Where the C2 server will send the agent commands through an ICMP Tunnel and the agent will return the results, also, through the ICMP Tunnel.

## Note that:
– This POC requires you to install Scapy (https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
– This POC will not involve handling with fragmentation. Fragmentation will occur, for example, if the answer from the agent will be bigger then the allowed Payload Data size.
